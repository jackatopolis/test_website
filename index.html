    <h1>Python-APIs-Challenge</h1>
    <h3>By: Jack Cohen</h3>
    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this python script is to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The goal is to model weather patterns as they relate to latitude. Data is extracted from OpenWeatherMap API and citipy library is used to find nearest cities.</p>
    <p>The script creates a .csv file with the data from each city and creates/saves plots for the following relationships:
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
